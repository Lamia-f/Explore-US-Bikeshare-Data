### Date created

### Project Title
Bikeshare project

### Description
I used three csv files of bikeshare data at three cities to find data statistics

### Files used
1-chicago.csv
2-new_york_city.csv
3-washington.csv
4-bikeshare.py

### The data sets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

-Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
-End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
-Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
-Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
-End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
-User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

-Gender
-Birth Year
